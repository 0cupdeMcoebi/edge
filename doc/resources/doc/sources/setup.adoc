= How to build your own project upon Edge

Edge is designed to be built upon.
You are free to make whatever changes you like (additions and deletions), in accordance with the <<_license>> (MIT).

== Create a new project

.Create new project
[source,shell]
----
src$ mkdir acme
src$ cd acme
acme$ git init
acme$ git remote add edge https://github.com/juxt/edge.git
acme$ git pull edge master
----

== Create a remote (optional)

It's a good idea at this point to have somewhere to back up your commits.

For example, if you create a new repository on GitHub called `acme` under the organisation `acme`, you could add the repository to your project like this:

.Create a git remote
[source,shell]
----
acme$ git remote add origin git@github.com:acme/acme.git
acme$ git push -u origin master
----

== Create a new app

With your new project created, you're ready to create an app.
Apps are deps.edn projects within Edge which are intended to be run as a server.

From the root of the repo, run the `./bin/app` script.
It can be run with an optional flags which add support for Sass or Clojurescript, these are `--sass` and `--cljs` respectively.

[NOTE]
====
Your project name should be namespaced to match your application.
If your company was named "Acme" you might use "acme/api" or "com.acme/api".

If you're unsure, use your company name at work, or your github username for hobby projects.
There's a low chance of conflicts in an application.

The project namespace will determine the Clojure namespaces within your application.
====

[source,shell]
----
edge$ ./bin/app acme/api
edge$ ./bin/app acme/blog --sass
edge$ ./bin/app acme/dashboard --cljs
edge$ ./bin/app acme/radar --sass --cljs
----
