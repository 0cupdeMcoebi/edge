= Edge App

Until CIDER 0.17 has been released (which brings improved support for
Clojure CLI), please use a terminal to run `clj`.

Start a REPL:

----
$ ./bin/repl
[Edge] Starting development environment, please wait...
[Edge] Starting nREPL server
[Edge] nREPL client can be connected to port 5600
[Rebel readline] Type :repl/help for online help info
[Edge] Loading Clojure code, please wait...
Successfully compiled build :main to "target/public/edge.js" in 1.564 seconds.
Figwheel: Starting CSS Watcher for paths  ["target"]
[Edge] Now enter (go) to start the dev system
----

This starts an nrepl-server, the port is 5600.

Start the system:

----
dev=> (go)
19:49:04.734 [main] INFO  edge.httpd - Started web-server on port 3000
[Edge] Website can be browsed at http://null/
[Edge] Now make code changes, then enter (reset) here
:initiated
----

Now make changes to the source code under `src`. When you're ready to reload these changes into the system, perform a reset:

----
dev=> (reset)
:reloading (...)
19:50:12.160 [main] INFO  edge.httpd - Started web-server on port 3000
:resumed
dev=>
----

Each time you make a change, re-issue the `(reset)` at the REPL.

== Cursive support

Current versions of Cursive don't support `deps.edn`, but will work with a `pom.xml`.

You can generate the `pom.xml` with the following command:

----
$ clojure -Spom
